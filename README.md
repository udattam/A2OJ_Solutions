# A2OJ Solutions
This repository contains the solution to problems in the A2OJ ladder. 
## Motivation behind the project
Completing this ladder is like learning the alphabet for someone getting started with competitive programming. So, when I began to do the problems in the list, what I noticed was the tutorials were either not clear enough for a beginner or there were no tutorial. This usually makes the aspiring competitive programmers go away. So I present this repository which contains my solutions to various problems in the ladder. This also solves an issue that is faced by a small category of programmers, people who use Java. All the solutions are written in Java. Happy coding!
